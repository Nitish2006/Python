    "# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept\n",
    "Abstraction in OOP is a mechanism that:\n",
    "- Hides complex implementation details\n",
    "- Exposes only essential features of an object\n",
    "- Provides a simplified view of complex systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Abstraction in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Abstract Classes\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        # Mandatory method to be implemented by child classes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interfaces\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Drawable:\n",
    "    def draw(self):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclass must implement abstract method\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self._balance = balance  # Protected attribute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        # Abstract method - must be implemented by child classes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        # Abstract method - must be implemented by child classes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        # Concrete method - provides common functionality\n",
    "        return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "class SavingsAccount(BankAccount):\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        # Specific implementation for savings account\n",
    "        self._balance += amount\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        # Specific implementation with savings account rules\n",
    "        if amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "            self._balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Hiding**\n",
    "   - Internal complexities are hidden\n",
    "   - Only necessary details are exposed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contract Definition**\n",
    "   - Defines a contract for subclasses\n",
    "   - Ensures consistent interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces complexity\n",
    "- ✅ Increases code reusability\n",
    "- ✅ Provides a clear, simple interface\n",
    "- ✅ Supports loose coupling\n",
    "- ✅ Enhances security by hiding implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "🚗 **Car Abstraction**\n",
    "- Driver sees: Steering wheel, pedals, gear shift\n",
    "- Hidden: Engine internals, electrical systems, complex mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Abstraction is NOT the same as inheritance\n",
    "- ❌ It's not about completely hiding implementation\n",
    "- ❌ It's about smart, selective exposure of functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use abstract base classes\n",
    "- Define clear interfaces\n",
    "- Keep abstractions focused and simple\n",
    "- Avoid over-engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip**: Good abstraction makes complex systems feel simple and intuitive!"
